📁 Portfolio Application – GitOps Repository

Overview

This repository manages the deployment of my personal portfolio application using GitOps principles.

The goal of this repo is not to store application source code, but to act as the single source of truth for Kubernetes deployment state, managed by ArgoCD.

All changes to the portfolio infrastructure and Kubernetes resources are applied automatically through GitOps workflows.
