# 🏠 Homelab GitOps Platform (Kubernetes + Argo CD)

A hands-on **GitOps implementation** running on a self-hosted Kubernetes homelab using **Argo CD**.  
This repository is the **single source of truth** for everything deployed to the cluster.

All changes flow through Git.  
No manual `kubectl apply`.  
No configuration drift.

---

## Architecture Overview

> GitHub → Argo CD → Kubernetes  
> Docker images are pulled from Docker Hub at runtime.

## What This Repo Does

- Manages Kubernetes applications declaratively
- Uses Argo CD for continuous reconciliation
- Automatically rolls out changes when Git updates
- Exposes apps using Traefik + nip.io
- Mirrors real production GitOps workflows

This is not a demo script.  
This is a working GitOps platform.

##  GitOps Flow (High Level)

Code Change → GitHub → Argo CD → Kubernetes
↑
Docker Hub

- CI builds and pushes images to Docker Hub
- CD pulls desired state from this repository
- Argo CD keeps the cluster in sync with Git

---

### Image Deployment Strategy

This platform follows strict GitOps principles.

- Docker images are built and tagged using immutable Git commit SHAs
- Image updates are committed back to the GitOps repository
- Argo CD deploys only when Git changes
- Container registries do not trigger deployments directly

This ensures full traceability, reproducibility, and safe rollbacks.

Each application is:
- Isolated by namespace
- Fully declarative
- Continuously reconciled by Argo CD

## 🚀 Live Example

**Portfolio Application**

- Namespace: `portfolio`
- Replicas controlled via Git
- Automatic rollout on manifest change
- Exposed via Traefik ingress

🌐 **Access URL**  

http://portfolio.192.168.1.70.nip.io

---

##  What This Demonstrates

- Real GitOps behavior (not manual deployments)
- Clear separation of CI and CD
- Kubernetes reconciliation in action
- Argo CD health, sync, and drift handling
- Production-style repository layout

This setup reflects how modern platform teams operate.

## 📌 Notes

This repository is part of my ongoing homelab platform used to:
- Experiment with GitOps patterns
- Validate production-grade workflows
- Showcase real-world Kubernetes operations
